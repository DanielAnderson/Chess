This is my chess program, written in pure Java. As of now, it is capable of supporting a two player game from the GUI. It highlights the possible moves that a selected piece can go, and if you click on one of them moves that piece there (provided that the move wouldn't put you into check). Both the check, and checkmate sequence are in, however it erroneously doesn't stop you from playing after a checkmate.

The plan is to write a AI that can be played against, or that you can watch play against itself
