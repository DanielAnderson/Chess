This is my chess program, written in pure Java. As of now, it is capable of supporting a two player game from the GUI, or either (or both) players being controlled by an AI. As of now, the AI simply chooses a random move to make with no analysis

The next goal is to create a fairly simple AI, though one that actually 'thinks'.
