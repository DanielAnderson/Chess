This is my chess program, written in pure Java. As of now, it is capable of supporting a two player game from the GUI, or either (or both) players being controlled by an AI. 

The AI's currently implemented are:
RandomAI: An AI which chooses a random move to make from all legal moves.
RandomAggressive: An AI which choose a random move which takes an opposing piece, or if none are possible, defaults to doing what RandomAI would do.

The next goal is to create a fairly simple AI, though one that actually 'thinks' and plans ahead.

To get the program to run, the jar must be in the same directory as the Pieces directory.
